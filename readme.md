üöÄLogging with Golang, Docker, Cloud, and Loki
Overview
This project demonstrates a complete logging pipeline, from generating logs in a Golang service to storing and visualizing them using Loki. It includes containerization with Docker, log rotation with LogRotate, cloud storage using S3, and monitoring with Loki.

üîπ Key Features
Golang Logging ‚Äì Generates logs with different levels (INFO to ERROR).
Docker Integration ‚Äì Ensures the service runs smoothly in any environment.
Log Rotation ‚Äì Uses LogRotate to manage and archive logs.
Cloud Storage ‚Äì Uploads logs to Amazon S3 for backup.
Loki Monitoring ‚Äì Visualizes logs for easy analysis.
üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
Golang ‚Äì For log generation.
Docker ‚Äì For containerization.
AWS CLI ‚Äì For uploading logs to S3 (or Azure CLI for Azure Blob).
Loki ‚Äì For log visualization.
LogRotate ‚Äì For log management.
üìå Steps to Set Up
1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Logs with Golang
Navigate to the project folder: cd cmd
Run the Golang service: go run main.go
View logs in the terminal.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Service in Docker
Go to the project root: cd ..
Build the Docker image: docker build -t golang-logging-service .
Start the container: docker run -d golang-logging-service
3Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Log Rotation
Modify logrotate.conf as needed.
Mount a volume when running Docker.
Run log rotation manually: logrotate -f logrotate.conf
4Ô∏è‚É£ Store Logs in S3
Configure AWS CLI for S3 access.

Create a script (upload_logs.sh) to upload logs:

bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
AWS_BUCKET="your-s3-bucket"
LOG_FILE="path/to/rotated/logfile.log"
aws s3 cp "$LOG_FILE" "s3://$AWS_BUCKET/logs/$(basename "$LOG_FILE")"
Automate uploads using cron.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Monitor Logs with Loki
Configure Loki to read logs from S3.

Use Grafana or Loki CLI to query logs:

text
Copy
Edit
{job="golang-logging-service"}
‚öôÔ∏è Customization
Edit logrotate.conf for specific log rotation settings.
Modify upload_logs.sh to change storage location.
Adjust Loki settings for better visualization.
üîÆ Future Enhancements
Integrate Fluentd or Logstash for better log management.
Add advanced log filtering in Loki.
Automate log upload monitoring.
Expand to Azure Blob storage.
Create Grafana dashboards for visualization.
Implement CI/CD for automated logging pipeline.
This setup ensures a smooth and efficient logging system, making log management and monitoring easier! üöÄ
